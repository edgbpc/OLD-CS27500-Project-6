mysh.c

In PS1 parsing, my case statement only checks for the required options from the assignment specifications and ignores all others 
the prompt is rebuilt every time the while loop is processed in order to keep the current directory accurate in the prompt.

used unset PS1 to validate the program does display $ when there is no PS1 defined

cd and exit commands are built in to the shell 

extra credit portion of the assignment was accomplished by turning ignoring ctrl c at start of the while loop and when if statement that forks the child process is executed, default behavior for ctrl c is re-enabled.  When child process terminates, either via ctrl c or natural completion of the process, ctrl c is one again ignored when the while loop repeats.

added a message when ctrl c is used that describes when it can be used

added function to replace string in HOME with ~ to truncate working directory.



shell tested using a number of different commands including:
ls -l
ls
exit (built in)
cd (built in)
cd .. functions 
vi 
mysh (starting another instance of the shell)
mkdir
rmdir
